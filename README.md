# ICM notebook

This repository accompanies the paper [arXiv:2404.16658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16658), which presents an inference framework consistent with the predictive model. The repository contains an example notebook demonstrating the ICM method using the single particle model and synthetic data generated from a pseudo-2D (P2D) battery model. A comparison with the traditional Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) is also included.

Simulations based on the P2D model are performed using [Dandeliion](http://www.dandeliion.com).

## Requirements
`scipy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `joblib`.

## Usage
The demonstration notebook is `GITT_vs_ICM.ipynb` in the root directory. Simply clone or download the repository and run the notebook in any standard Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks (e.g. JupyterLab, VS Code, or equivalent).
